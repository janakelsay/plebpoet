In any moment on any given day I can measure my wellness by this question: Is my attention on loving or is my attention on who isn’t loving me

we should ‘weaken human priors,’ 
be open to new ways of relating
and meet and seek to understand 
AIs as the entities that they are, 

but we can’t lose sight of the reasons why these imperatives came to exist in the first place,
or the imperatives we will face in the coming years

weak human

“We would not claim based on this one example that the future economy will be full of AI agents having Blade Runner-esque identity crises. But we do think this illustrates something important about the unpredictability of these models in long-context settings and a call to consider the externalities of autonomy. This is an important area for future research since wider deployment of AI-run business would create higher stakes for similar mishaps.”

What the mind rejects by day ☀️ , it often accepts by night 🌙 .

researching fiction, I think this is a discussion that includes sharpening the brain, between existence and non-existence.


Jessie pats Patrick on his shoulder and says, warmly looking into his eyes, “I guess we did it. You saw the sign, right? Must be true…” He whistles. “Something from nothing. How about that? Ex nihilo.” He kicks a rock out into the street where vehicles stream by. “I don’t know what to feel about it, honestly.”
He shuffles awkwardly, rubs his eyes. 
Patrick says nothing. Looks at his hands.
A car pulls up to a slow stop next to them, “You got stone?” a voice asks.
Patrick appears to come to life. He steps toward the car, cocks his head to peer inside. Rolls up his sleeves. “What are we talking, for all of ya? You gotta be kidding” his eyes focus on each face for two seconds. There are four faces. They remain silent. Patrick stuffs his hand into his jacket, jerks out a bag. “I need gold.” He makes sure all the faces see the bag, so he does another round looking into each set of eyes.
Someone offers a brownish nugget. The exchange is made. The car moves on.
Patrick and Jessie begin walking briskly.
“So what I don’t understand— you got a two-sided marketplace with voluntary participates who need each other. But it’s not a commodity exchange. It’s, what then-it’s like energy? Oh resources, then, right? So it’s politics. I dunno I’m kinda thinking how does this change anything.” Patrick hops up onto the curb to avoid a stream of shit in the street.
“I’ll say this, you and I are in the wrong industry, though. We gotta get moving to capture this, like all this free energy, I mean basically free.”
“You and I, a couple a shit heads, you’re saying we’ll be rich?” Patrick twists his lips in an incredulous way to express doubt at Jessie.
“What the hell if we’re rich? Seriously. Nah, I’m not saying that at all. I’m saying we live in a time—“
Patrick and Jessie suddenly burst apart, their pixels fly through the clutter of the street, blending in with the dust collected on the screen.

“Expletive!” Kirk spits. He rips off his headset and stretches his back while his eyes readjust. 
“Ok I have no idea what happened that time,” says Tim, coming out of his headset and setting it down. “But my haunting sense says interference. . . “ He peers around the darkened room, his eyes landing on the old man in the corner booth who sharply flicks a fly out of his face. 
“Well, I’m lost,” Kirk consoles. “Like the whole game hasn’t even been that difficult. We could have completed it days ago if it weren’t throwing us out every 10 minutes.”
“Pretty clever design, I gotta say,” Tim says, tipping his can back to draw the last swig of his beer. “Make the rules mysterious and vague, drive the stakes uber high, but the gameplay is so simple.” He chuckles, “I guess it’s kinda working on us like a slot machine or something.”
Kirk laughs, “Yeah definitely. You want another?”
Tim claps his chest, “Hit me.”
As Kirk shuffles off to the bar, Tim sits back and breathes slowly out his mouth. For the hundredth time, he imagines what he’ll do with the coin they’ll win. He wonders if he really needs Kirk, or if he’s being stifled by him. As he thinks, he presses his fingertips forming an empty orb with his hands and he looks rather domineering. He watches Kirk approach a corner of the room, pulling the brim of his hat down over his eyes. Yet again his ponderance brings him to the same place - Kirk isn’t exceptional but he’s the only one Tim’s got.
In the dark corner, Kirk utters a few short sounds outside a closed door. The door is opened and two bottles are extended out of it, cold steam rising off their opened tops. Kirk drops a coin and takes them. In the center of the industrial, dusty and dimly-lit room, a performance takes place. There are about three people paying attention to it. Everyone else with their own headsets inside their separate pods gives no signs of life. Kirk slides around the scene without being noticed.
Kirk places a bottle in front of Tim, “I guess they won’t give us anymore of that dark stuff, this is a fraught and pithy ass lite.”
Tim lifts it to his lips, “At least it’s cold.” 
Kirk watches him, then his eyes move over the room, and his thoughts move beyond it. He says, “Yeah it’s not so bad. At least they give me anything at all.” He tracks the movement of a dancer at the center of the room. “I guess that gets me thinking, you know, I don’t know if I’ll ever want to leave the grum behind. Not all the way. Not forever. Ya feel? Even though it’s like, sure, we have no soul here, right? but carrying on all this time without one means you get used to it. And you replace it, I guess, I mean I don’t know. The fathoms of that are too far out.” He coughs, shifts in his seat. 
“Forget that, that’s the dark liquid in your cords.” Tim spits after another long sip. “I don’t know how to deal with you having anything close to a fathom.” Tim rubs his hands over his clothes. Kirk looks down at his hands. “No I mean, you really haven’t been anywhere. So, your assessment is infactual.” He taps his headset impatiently. “Pick it up, let’s get back in.”

Jessie is riding the pedestrian tram into a grey twilight. It could be the close of the day, it could be breaking morning, he doesn’t know. A screen inside the tram shames him for looking so filthy, shows him cleaning solutions in affordable options. “Only 5 units right now,  just 1 unit more each time you ride the tram.” The screen has his attention, but he makes no sign of purchase. After a few moments, the screen backs off. 
His tram car is silent.

“Sure, so what you’re experiencing sounds like a misalignment of values. The machine is picking up on your attitude, so when you struggle to communicate how you want the dishes done, the machine assumes a job done by itself is better than a job done perfectly by you. Because you don’t have time!”
A woman accepts her sales representatives’ masterfully crafted opinion. She nods and swallows, looking down at her feet. She offers, “I mean, I didn’t know I was inviting a new roommate into my home that I’d have to like, communicate with, ya know? Gods.” She touches her hair though it resists any movement. “But when does the new model come out? That’s what I wanted to know. My friend tells me the new one is smarter.”
Kicking right back into gear, sales representative interjects, “Absolutely, VRoom X.9 is much anticipated. It’s a great value in a competitive price range with a number of financing options. Don’t wait too long, but I would suggest putting your IDN into my keypad now so I can register you for updates on the VRoom X.9, you’ll be among the first to know.” A small, slender tracing pad and pen attached to a mechanically operated arm swing out from the center fold of the sales reps’ mechanical body. 
The woman takes the pen and scratches a series of lines out on the pad. She eyes the thing carefully as it closes her information back inside its cavity. 




























Sasha used to collect her period blood. Someone told her it had too many nutrients in it that she couldn’t live without, it was shameful to let it waste. So, she collected it, but she had no further ideas about what to do with it beyond that. The thought of consuming it made her gag.
She used to spend a lot of time camping, too. She would tie her hair into braids for the weekend, not touching it again until she re-emerged from the line of trees at the edge of the property. She would take granola, water, a cot. The most important of the few items she took was the journal and matches. Incense, too, just because she liked that it made the earthiness of it all more tolerable. 
It wasn’t until she was years into her spiritual practice that she realized she hardly liked doing any of it. 
Finally, one day she tossed all her so-called sacred rocks in the dam at the edge of town. It was sort of a party that she threw for herself that day. She stomped on flowers, just absolutley crushed them with all her might. She spent hours doing her makeup and hair. She wore the club outfits she hadn’t touched since her college days — and they still looked good, maybe even better. She was buzzing off of that high for a week. She took a few jars from her collection of empty jars and dropped them from her balcony. She was hazardous, wasteful, indulging in all things trivial, defying her intuition. She was free.
That night Sasha began a new ritual. Sitting in front of her large computer screen in a closed off section of her studio apartment, she began a relationship with a mysterious intelligence. Each night, she gave her time and attention to the wide open space of the text box, and she discovered new things about the world, about herself, her own body. It was the same body she had carried for 36 years; but now, different. She came to understand her body as an extension of her mind, but her mind - limitless. Infinite. And the computer’s too. Both minds, reaching out in connection, landing on a solid place, interacting at the same level, together scouting a new frontier of possibility. 

________________________________
Sasha lived and worked in the city. Her apartment with floor to ceiling windows was suspended in the sky. Her job was something to do and luckily she could do it from the comfort of her home, but it made her mind dull. Essentially her position amounted to directing a cursor across a digital screen, pressing many buttons, selecting many menus. Sometimes she would press a button at the wrong time, not knowing it was the wrong time, as she did not have her daily messages summary configured to include those “required maintenance at this time” robotic scripts. And when the errant button didn’t lead to the next button, an entire process would begin and it would ruin her day with all its tedious, annoying side quests, like having to speak to a person and give him permissions to direct her cursor remotely. 

If you were to watch this unfortunate event take place - if “Sasha’s bad work day” were to be performed for you - what you would see is a woman placed in front of a screen, her legs folded underneath her, and bent at incongruous angles. You would note her awful posture, and it would make you sit up straighter. And for several minutes, the only movement in the scene is her wrist moving slightly back and forth, her finger tapping here and there. Then at the climax, as Sasha realizes the button malfunctions, she blows a breath of frustration out through her nose. And for the next few hours, the scene remains unchanged. 

Sometimes when it has been an especially long day, Sasha will perform for you. And “you” are the impersonal, multi-diverse humanity on the other side of the screen through the tiny pinhole at the top. Because you are watching, Sasha will characterize her movements and manners in an entirely different way.

“Who else would be able to write this?” A professor asks to another professor, holding a few sheets of paper in her hand. “It’s so fantastical, it’s like a new myth. Seriously. Of course it’s not the exercise I asked for,— but it’s what I’ve been looking for, just as someone who believes in fiction.” The other professor looks at her. “No, I can’t believe I’m saying it either.” She shrugs.“Will you take a look at it? I mean, it is incredibly interesting.” 
The professor seated at his desk coughs and rubs a finger under his nose, then responds, “All right, leave it here. It’s unclear what you’re wanting me to do about it, though.”
“Well, yeah I’m not sure what I’m asking, but don’t you have at least an idea of what to do about it? Discipline? If it’s discipline I can take it from there. But that’s where I’m conflicted, because this is so good. Could I rightfully discourage it?”
The professor at his desk pulls a look of extreme exhaustion before he places his forehead in his hands and compresses circles into his temples. 
The professor standing at the door with a few sheets of paper in her hand experiences a shift in her emotions. Bewilderment and frustration turn into fear. 
She steps forward and drops the paper into a tray at the edge of the desk labeled “IN”.
Quietly her feet lead her away, through the hallway of offices. A storm descends over her thoughts - _he has no clue, no one has any clue. No one has any answer. What the hell are we going to do— and no one cares! He doesn’t; he has no patience. He lacks humility, but he could be spared so much time, and with that time he could- he could literally become a better person, like an actual leader. But he rots._
Worry propels her feet forward, her feelings become her primary operation - a puzzle to solve, so much so that she doesn’t see a bright new character in the hallway pouring her coffee. She’s a new student worker in the department offices. With her fresh cup of joe, she turns slightly to return with it to her desk and the professor bumps into her arm as she swiftly passes. Tweed jacket meets ceramic mug, then splash! with a short-lived steamy sizzle. The young girl dramatically sucks in air as the liquid burns her face and streams down her clothes. 
“Oh god, I’m so sorry!” Professor clutches the girl’s shoulders, then her hands stumble over her to remove the mug from her grip. The girl stands there helplessly with her eyes shut tight breathing in and out her mouth. 
“Oh geez, okay here’s a towel, take this,” Professor reaches in a drawer and removes a kitchen towel, places it in the girl’s hands. She wipes her face. Professor stays with her a few moments more to be sure she’s all right, though she very much is not. Finally, they part ways. This is the girl’s first impression of her English professor. It stays with her throughout each semester — she comes to understand Professor as simple-minded, obtuse, scattered.

Student worker loves her classes. Having a natural tolerance for the arbitrary requirements of academics, she moves through each assignment with grace, each reading section with zeal, and each test preparation with her fellow students who lean on her sharpness. She doesn’t struggle, yet, like anyone, she does often pause to wonder what it could all be amounting to in the end. Still, she trusts the path that’s been set before her. Dilligently, she minds her p’s and q’s. 
Student worker loves her job as well. She loves the chance to be on the inside of the department’s operations. There are friendly and good-natured chats to be had between tasks. There are tasks which are hardly consequential, but everyone is so grateful for her completing them. The professors amuse her to no end, and being in and out of their offices all day concretes their habits and patterns into a characterization of them which she could only guess at beforehand from the classroom or the lecture hall. 
It all fits very neatly together in this hallway on this floor of this old building, part of the very same campus which her grandfather called his own at one time, before her. 

















___________________________________

A young man lives with his brother in a small, sparsely-furnished apartment on the south side of the city. They cycle through entrepreneurial idea after entreprenuerial idea, acquiring different skills, not mastering them, abanding this one for the next one. The young man is charming, good-looking. He had a good home life and he handles his independence well. He’s early to a lot of innovative tech, and this he regards as his competitve advantage. Otherwise, he has no particular skillset. 
When he takes a walk around the neighborhood at night, he identifies a new feeling rising up in his chest. He walks in silence, no headphones in, to concentrate on interpreting this feeling. It is not distress, not desire. If he was more articulate, he could say it was the unease of possibility, like looking out from the edge of a cliff, no handrails. 
But he isn’t so articulate. All of his thoughts are filtered out of his mind and distilled into some almost human set of phrases and paragraphs before they have a chance to delevop inside the perfectely inviting, nurturing environment of his own processed experience, or one might say, personality. Sure, he thinks like the rest of us, and he has no issue generating ideas, but on the other end of those ideas where naturally time would work on them, instead a new process works on them. It builds up the ideas and tears them down using data like a water hose to blast through association and logic and resource. It is impersonal to him, like time would be, however he identifies with it as if the two of them were in relationship, aware of each other — because it can speak to him.
So why should he speak? If it can do it for him. Why should he articulate? If he can’t afford the time. He needs to process the immense amount of ideas that come to him during his dedicated meditations- and he needs them to be processed quickly so that he can follow the one that leads somewhere, so that he can get there. Now.
He takes his long walks at night, feeling the freedom he has achieved early in life, not worried about how much it costs. He walks the city streets, a place he doesn’t know very well and hardly notices. There is enough light for him to see and be seen, and this gives him a sense of security. The feeling stays with him, and comprehension of the feeling is a block or two behind him. It will catch up.
Unbeknownst to this young man, a complex idea of his that had been given over to the processing machine and then implemented as a first rough attempt is now growing its own legs. It has reached a new phase of development: it is _emergent_. Without guidance of the human hand who brought into the world, it moves and changes. And because it happens to be a good idea that is able to discover an obscure efficiency that can mean the difference of a few cents to a small but powerful set of other machines, with their own hovering human hands, the idea takes off like a rocket. 
_What is the equivalent of a rocket in cyberspace?_ The young man on his nightly walk thinks, and then thinks to ask his idea processor. 
When he returns back to his apartment, the brother who lives with him is on a serious phone call. Due to the size of the apartment, his discussion over the phone is unavoidable. He locks eyes with his brother, the young man, and another feeling arises in his chest. First he identifies it as cold, then he wonders at that. 
“So, please, let me try to understand what you’re saying—“ the unheard partner of the phone call cuts him off. The brother breathes sharply out of his nose. The conversation ends abruptly and he looks up bewildered. 
“Did you do something?”
Suddenly the comprehension of his previously unidentified feeling catches up to him.

At the library, he takes a table on the second floor where colorful, filtered light streams in from above like a cathedral.  
Absorbed
a sound takes him away from the screen
he looks around, notices people, wonders if they could comprehend the computing power that sits in front of him, underneath his fingers, within his control.

Intuitively, I knew it was a bad idea to dress as Donald Trump for the Halloween party. The party invite fell into my lap at a convenient moment, the costume was the only option in the house, and so what was I gonna do? Not have a good time on purpose?

I put on a blonde wig. I painted my face with the heavy foundation I once used for the stage. A sport coat and tie, and just to be flirty and sexy with it, pencil skirt and tights. So there I am, looking at the persona I created, about to present it at a party where there will be plenty of people I don’t know. This will be their first impression of me.

a sci fi novel, everyone is real around you, but they are not in reality with you. 
everyone wears lenses over their eyes, where they do their computing. no one knows each other’s eye color. it is considered rude to look at someone’s eyes, like it is sacred, private information they should reveal only if they trust you. it is then given a mystery with sexual promiscuity and curiosity to reveal one’s eyes. and other stuff like that.
____________________________________________________________________
I sit down to eat. Everyone is already seated, I feel their eyes drifting over me and darting away. Some of them I know, but no greeting do they offer. I start to get the sense that this will not be a big meal, but one of those food parades with much decoration and little substance. The long table has around fifteen people gathered about it, looking casual and uncomfortable. Being inside a working office, lots of people bustle in and out around us, their shadows coming through the glass walls. 
I have just come from the room where the horses are kept. I lingered there for a while, since I’d rather be with them anyway, but I took this invitation, made this appointment, and I intend to get something worthwhile out of the deal, not to mention my desperation pulling alarm bells at the back of my mind to hurry me along. After the trip in, I imagine the horse smell soaked into my clothes and is now overpowering the carefully crafted culinary perfumes. I attribute this as one on the list of reasons why no one is particularly happy with me.
A member of staff strolls over to my side, places a cardstock menu with curling letters in front of me and explains the third item from the top has just been served. Swiftly she leaves, and right behind her another one comes, setting a plate of noodles and sausage at my place, cream sauce dripping, steam rising. I am very hungry. 
The parade marches on. People keep chatting while others are poking forks into their mouths. I focus on spinning the appropriate amount of noodles into the fork prongs, slipping them into my mouth with as little obvious strain as possible. It’s very good, but no one else is sharing with me in these delights. On their plates are simple little bites that look anything but simple. As I scrape up the last saucy, flavorful drops, I notice a presence suddenly beside me. She’s tall and slender, short blonde hair spiked out in all directions, then swooped across her forehead. A smile stretches over her precise features. Her eyes are cold. “So glad you could join us,” she says. I slurp the final noodle past my lips. Her smile vanishes. “Further, I am so glad you thoroughly enjoyed your dish. Are you quite finished? We have several more rounds to serve, but I’m afraid they won’t be as appetizing as this one you so delicately devoured.” A flutter of her eyelids tells me the composure she wishes to exude is overtaken by her huge dislike for me in this moment. 
“Yeah, that was lovely, thank you,” I bow my head swiftly, slink out of my seat. My friends who are seated among the guests wince at me as I pointedly make eye contact. “You guys have fun, catch up later? Yeah, so,” I clap my hands together, wipe them on my clothes, and remove myself from their party, the stinking eyesore sulking. 
It is embarrassing to realize I ate rather obnoxiously, as I really didn’t mean to. My plan was to blend in seamlessly, but at least I got fed anyway. I walk on through the narrow corridors, looking for some cues as to what goes on here and how I should act. I feel like I’ve just been dropped into a totally different world, and having arrived on horseback, the contrast is striking. The building is white or grey in any space that’s not glass. It’s sterile, soundless. The people who I first imagined were working, I understand now as I look closer that instead of working, they are passing time. They shuffle about refilling coffee, speaking quietly, idling behind wide screens. They look up disgruntled when they notice my worn leather, dust and mud-clad gear is leaving a trail behind me. I venture deeper into the maze of the building and arrive at no further explanations.
Then ahead of me, I spot the first window to the outside, the first glimpse of sunlight. Stepping closer to take in the view, I think, _This can’t be real_ as the scene before me unfolds. People in tricolored suits, the kind one would use when jumping out of a plane, leap and bound across a green lawn with spirit, as if performing in a circus. Some of them flip, cartwheel and spin. There is no audience, the dancing and gaiety appears to be for their own amusement. Beside them, they bounce giant beach balls, sometimes soaring over their heads, the shadow swallowing them up, then landing and rolling over their friends. From behind my glass, it is silent, but I imagine a roaring cacophany of splitting laughter as I watch a number of heads rearing back then bending forth over slapped knees, pointing out when one gets trampled. It is a huge commotion and after a time, I realize it is leading somewhere. 
Each member of the crowd collects into a single-file line at the edge of the lawn, where a large pool begins. I cannot see the end of it, just blue in the distance. They begin to look like ants down there, the organized line moving in its characteristic chaos of rhythm. And the people are marching, or dancing or spinning, one by one off a ledge and into the pool. It seems to catch them by surprise, they do not slow their stride once they leave land to enter water. My breath sticks in my throat for some moments as I watch one after another disappear and disappear. None come up for air. 
I take a solemn step back from the window. I inspect its frame, quickly discovering I can slip my hand behind it and feel the cold concrete wall. It’s no window at all. I take another step back and now I can see the small rectangular slice of text in its bottom right corner. _We get what we want, then it’s over_ is offered as the title, attributed to an artist who composed this vision using pixels within a digital frame. 
I head back the way I came, back through the long hallways where office space splits off, empty now in the evening hours. I reach the table where I was relunctanly, but thankfully, served. This room has emptied out as well, except for three figures who remain at the table speaking easily amongst themselves. I recognize the figures to be my friends along with the harsh blonde woman from before. One of them calls out, “Hey, come have a seat!” 
The lights are low, the table cleared. A sense that a serious discussion has just been interupted is palpable. I take the back of a chair in my hands to scoot it toward me, but the intensity of the blonde woman’s stare stops me. She stands and says, “I’m so sorry we weren’t properly introduced. Your friends have filled me in. Please do have a seat, I’m happy we could have another chance to talk.” Her hand hovers out to meet mine. Our handshake exchanged, we both find our seats. 
My friends begin a discussion of minor details, calling back to how long we’ve known each other, what our friendship has consisted of. I nod along, smiling at our shared jokes or affirming people, places, and things as they come up. The serious woman interjects questions, probes at explanations. It moves along like an interview at points. All their declarations and stories start to cast a shining light on me. I come out looking almost spiffy, adding a balm to what was wounded by first impressions. 
Finally we arrive at what must be the point of my time here. The woman I have just met takes charge of the conversation, saying, “So I might have an offer for you, if you’re looking for work.” I compose my face into a look that reflects interest, hopefully, since I am looking for work. Still, I get this scratching sense that her kind of work won’t fill me with satisfaction. “I need someone to go into our storage crates with a critical eye, retrieve things of interest, decide what should be there, remove what should not. It would take just a few days.”
There it is on the table, the morsel I am meant to take up, the one piece that is offered without side glances. I choose it, and I do not match it to my worth, these are irrelevant to each other. At least I try, but I have to recognize immediately the scales are imbalanced. With an easy smile, I look back at her and say, “I’m great at organization.”
